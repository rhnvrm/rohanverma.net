PLACEHOLDER: Replace with hand-drawn sketch icons for the feature cards.

Create these sketch-style icons (about 64x64px each):

1. pen-sketch.png - A hand-drawn pen or pencil icon
   - Simple line drawing of a pen/pencil
   - Slightly irregular lines, sketchy feel
   - Black ink on transparent background

2. lab-sketch.png - A hand-drawn laboratory/experiment icon  
   - Simple beaker, flask, or test tube sketch
   - Rough, hand-drawn lines
   - Could include bubbles or simple lab equipment
   - Black ink on transparent background

3. train-sketch.png - A hand-drawn train icon
   - Simple side view of a train or locomotive
   - Sketchy, imperfect lines
   - Can be minimalist but recognizable
   - Black ink on transparent background

These can be created by:
- Hand-drawing with pen and scanning
- Digital sketching with rough brushes
- Converting existing icons to sketch style
- AI tools for sketch generation

All icons should have a consistent hand-drawn aesthetic that matches the notebook theme.
