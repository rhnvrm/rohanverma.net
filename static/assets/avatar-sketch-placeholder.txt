PLACEHOLDER: Replace with a hand-drawn version of your avatar image.
Create a sketched avatar (about 200x200px) that looks like:
- Hand-drawn or sketched style, not a perfect photo
- Can be based on your existing avatar but with artistic, imperfect lines
- Black ink on white/transparent background
- Slightly irregular, personal feel
- Can be created by:
  - Drawing your avatar by hand and scanning
  - Using digital art tools with sketch brushes
  - Converting existing photo to sketch style
  - AI tools for sketch conversion
