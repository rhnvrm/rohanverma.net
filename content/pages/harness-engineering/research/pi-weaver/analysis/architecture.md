Three tools. That's it.

`checkpoint` saves a position. `time_lapse` rewinds to it. `done` says you're finished. The model decides when to use them. No rigid phases, no planning step, no gate calls between stages.

---

The predecessor was pi-exec — 1,656 lines of structured executor that broke tasks into phases with a planning step. Phase 0 generates a plan. Phase 1 through N execute it. A gate LLM validates each transition. State flows as JSON between phases.

It worked. 95.7% pass rate on internal eval tasks. But it was brittle in exactly the way that matters: the plan was fixed at the start. When Phase 2 reveals that the Phase 1 approach was wrong, there's no mechanism to go back. The model just pushes forward with accumulating context until it times out.

The [antirez insight](https://x.com/antirez/status/2037488794379653620) reframed the problem:

> One thing agent harnesses should be able to do is: to jump back in history trimming what follows, just injecting some self-steering text.

Instead of imposing structure, give the model tools to manage its own [context](@/pages/harness-engineering/context-windows.md). Let it decide when to save, when to rewind, when it's done. 1,656 lines collapsed into 410.

### How time_lapse actually works

The model calls `time_lapse("ready", "Found the bug. Fix _hkey/_hval.")`. Here's what happens:

1. The tool sets a flag: `pendingRewind = { label: "ready", steering: "Found the bug..." }`
2. If there are batched tool calls in the same response, they get blocked (they'd be pruned anyway)
3. Before the next LLM call, the `context` event fires. It finds the checkpoint message, truncates everything after it, appends the steering text as a user message
4. The model's next turn sees a clean context: system prompt → task → checkpoint → steering. Everything between is gone.

The cache prefix through the checkpoint stays warm. Anthropic's prompt caching recognizes the shared prefix. So the model sheds context without losing cache. That's where the [economics](economics.md) get interesting.

### Three tries to get here

This is the third architecture. The first two failed in ways that were invisible in unit tests and only surfaced during eval.

**Attempt 1**: The tool called `ctx.abort()` to stop the agent loop before rebuilding context. In print mode — which is how every eval runs — abort means exit. The followUp command never ran. Zero time_lapse invocations across 30+ eval attempts. We spent days thinking the model wouldn't use the tool. It was broken.

**Attempt 2**: Removed abort, queued the rewind via `sendUserMessage({ deliverAs: "followUp" })`. But tool blocking created new turns, preventing the idle state followUp needs. Infinite loop. 64 blocked tool calls in one run, $0.23 wasted. Tried `steer` delivery instead — the model treated the raw command text as user input and responded to it conversationally.

**Attempt 3**: The `context` event. Fires before each LLM call, can modify the message array directly. No commands, no timing dependencies, no mode-specific behavior. Works everywhere.

The lesson: agent extension APIs have sharp edges that only show up in production-like conditions. Unit tests pass. Eval runs fail silently.

### The prompt matters more than the code

Seven versions of the system prompt, each solving a different failure mode:

The model ignored abstract pseudocode patterns. It responded to concrete examples with tool call sequences. It couldn't count turns ("time_lapse after 3-5 failures") but it could respond to observable events ("your test just failed after edits"). It needed to understand context economics. *Why* early checkpointing matters, not just that it should checkpoint.

The current prompt teaches deterministic rules: `edit → test → fail → time_lapse`. No judgment call. The model sees a test failure after edits, it rewinds. That's the rule.

Even with good rules, the model sometimes grinds. A system reminder — injected into context when `lastTestFailed` and `editsSinceCheckpoint` are both true — nudges at the exact decision point where the model should rewind but historically doesn't.

The [per-task traces](../tasks/) show where this works and where it doesn't. The short version: the prompt shapes behavior more than the tools do.
