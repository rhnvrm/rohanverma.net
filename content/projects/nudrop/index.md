Yet another FOSS SecureDrop built on top of NuCypher and Ethereum.

## Background

Securedrop is a self-hostable web 2.0 app created originally by Aaron Swartz and now maintained by the Freedom of Press Foundation. It helps whistle-blowers submit data anonymously to media organizations.

NuDrop will utilize the cryptographic infra of NuCypher network and allow users to share and submit data anonymously by people such as whistleblowers and journalists to organizations such as media outlets. It provides a side-channel app on top of NuCypher which facilitates the communication.
