A free and open source, self-hosted alternative to link listing websites like LinkTree and Campsite.bio.

## Why LinkPage?

Link-in-bio services charge monthly fees for what is essentially a static page with links. LinkPage gives you the same functionality with full control over your data, hosted wherever you want.

## Features

- **Self-hosted**: Run on your own server or any static hosting
- **Customizable**: Full control over styling and layout
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your data, your rules
- **Simple setup**: Single binary or static files

## Use Cases

- Personal landing pages
- Creator link collections
- Business contact pages
- Portfolio link hubs
