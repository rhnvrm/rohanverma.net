## Inspiration

## suckless

[suckless](https://suckless.org) is known for their focus on simplicity and clarity. Their website is a good example of simple website design. I really liked how they use the two-column design as a mini-sitemap. This tree layout, is something that is familiar and intuitive to a lot of people. This inspired me to build [Bodhi](/projects/bodhi) to have a two-column layout with the column showing a tree like column on the left.
