# Setting up ox-hugo with Doom Emacs

I recently released my blog's [new theme](/projects/bodhi) on [hugo-themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/bodhi/). I had also started to re-learn Emacs for org-mode. I have a fully functional setup of Doom Emacs and have also been able to set up a workflow which works for me. My internal writing and documentation has improved as a result.

## Introduction

### Why I switched to Emacs

#### Doom Emacs
- Already Configured
- Don't need to remember bindings
- Evil Mode
  - Already know vim
  - Have tried spacemacs

#### Org Mode

### Why Hugo

### Why ox-hugo

## Setting up

Check out this helpful guide: [ox-hugo for the orgconfig](https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/06/ox-hugo-for-the-orgconfig/)

## Conclusion

*This post is still a work in progress.*
