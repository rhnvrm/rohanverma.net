Just installed a new theme for the blog called P2. I&#8217;m using a child theme called Mercury. Also installed and played with a bunch of plugins. Want to try micro blogging and also live blogging during my coding sessions.

Also, learnt that AJAX requests don&#8217;t seem to work behind proxies. P2 sends an initial Ajax request when you click on post from the front-end and it was failing, scourged the internet but couldn&#8217;t find a solution. So lesson learnt that you should always try a different device in such cases early on.
