I&#8217;m excited about attending ApacheCon Big Data and ApacheCon 16 at Seville, Spain. Only a few days are left. Talked with my mentor at Apache Allura, @brondsem today about his experiences at ApacheCon NA Denver 14 and what all I could do at ACEU 16. We&#8217;re hoping for improving the exposure of Apache Allura within the Apache community and trying to get some projects in the incubator to try Allura. I&#8217;ll try to present a lightning talk and host a demo session for Allura at the conference. Also, my work on the importer begins again tomorrow and hopefully it will be done before reaching Spain. Will share updates on this blog.
