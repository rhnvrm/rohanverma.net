At last, I am now on Fedora 25. It&#8217;s great to again be able to use VLC and TexStudio without having to do use any workarounds! Still need to test the Optimus improvements but can&#8217;t seem to be able to get Nvidia module to start. bbswitch is loaded. Need some time to figure this one out. I guess will have to try Dota 2 7.00 on WinDoze.

**Edit: **It now works perfectly. I&#8217;m happy.

Wow, wayland is seriously way smoother than X. One must-have gnome extension now is the &#8220;Gnome Shell Extension Reloader&#8221; since now you can&#8217;t simply reload X with \`ctrl+F2 r\` like in the old days.
