<img class="alignleft" src="https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/66616518.jpg" width="214" height="214" />I&#8217;m back to using WordPress from Jekyll. I followed <a href="http://davidlynch.org/url: blog/2016/01/migrating-from-jekyll-to-wordpress/" target="_blank">David Lynch&#8217;s blog post</a> to import my posts from the jekyll blog hosted on github.io

Although, I did not use the plugins made by him, they might be useful if you had a lot of Disqus comments in your blog.
