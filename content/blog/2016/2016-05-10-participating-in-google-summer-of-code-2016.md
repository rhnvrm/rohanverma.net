This summer I will be working on an open source project called [Apache
  
Allura][1]. This software powers [SourceForge.net][2]
  
and is developed
  
under the [Apache Software Foundation][3]. My mentors are
  
[Dave Brondsema][4]
  
and [Heith Seewald][5] who have been guiding me along the way during the application
  
period and the community bonding period and I hope to have an amazing summer working
  
with them.

I will keep updating my progress on this blog so stay tuned!
