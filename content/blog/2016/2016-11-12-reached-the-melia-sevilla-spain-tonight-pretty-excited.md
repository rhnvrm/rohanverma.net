Reached the Melia Sevilla, Spain tonight. Pretty excited about ApacheCon. Am planning on finalizing the presentations about Allura by tomorrow night and discuss them with @brondsem on Monday. 

It was a long trip to Sevilla via Madrid and London with @gauravsaini03, he will be speaking about Apache OFBiz which is a complete enterprise solution.

Met Dr Paul King(@paulk_asert), who is working on Apache Groovy and has worked on the &#8220;Groovy in Action&#8221; book by Manning publications. He has 3 back to back talks lined up at ApacheCon on Thursday about Groovy.
