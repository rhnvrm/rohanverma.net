I just realized that I have way more drafts pending in my blog than the actual posts that are published here. Maybe, it is because I am afraid of being incorrect. Well, today I have decided that I will not worry about being correct and will post rather than draft. The motivation to publish a pending draft drops exponentially for me with time. So, if any of my readers find any mistake in my posts; please notify me so that I can correct it for my and my readerâ€™s sake.

_Update_: The irony here is that I had left this post as a draft. Posting it here as a cruel joke on myself.
