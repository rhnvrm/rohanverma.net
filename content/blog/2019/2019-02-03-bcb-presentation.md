I recently got a chance to talk about [upi.link](https://upi.link)during 
[Techlash at Barcamp Bangalore](https://barcampbangalore.com/bcb/bcb-spring-2019/bcb-spring-2019-techlash/building-a-mobile-app-neutral-upi-request-link-generator-at-https-upi-link). 
I got to tell people about having started this small project. Here is the link to my presentation:

A small summary of [upi.link](https://upi.link)

<blockquote>
Introducing [upi.link](https://upi.link), which is is a Payment Service Provider (PSP) neutral
UPI Request Link generator built upon the UPI Deeplinking Spec, enabling SMEs and individual users
to collect payments directly by sharing links on chat apps or embedding on their own websites,
without having to rely on building their own mobile apps and calling intents, making manual
UPI requests on PSP apps, tying up with service aggregators that charge fees, or even
purchasing licenses to APIs when they are just getting started.
