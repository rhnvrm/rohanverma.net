You can get a free [BNC][1] account on [EliteBNC][2]. It runs [ZNC][3] which you can run yourself if you have a spare VPS. All you need to do is login on [FreeNode][4] (you can use their webchat if you don&#8217;t have a client handy) and join #EliteBNC channel and issue the following command command: `!request <username> freenode <your email id>` and you will get the settings in your email if your request is approved.
