Just discovered Xfce4 has an inbuilt Drop Down Terminal which you can use by running the command \`xfce4-terminal –drop-down\` using an Application Shortcut. Applications – Settings – Keyboard. Select the Application Shortcuts tab, click on the Add button, type in the command and give a shortcut key. I used F12.
