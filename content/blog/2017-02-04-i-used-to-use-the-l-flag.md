I used to use the \`-L\` flag in SSH but today I was going through the man page and saw the \`-D\` flag. It can be used to make a SOCKS5 proxy easily. For eg. \`ssh -f -N -D 8080 xyz@13.232.63.7\` 

Also, a big thanks to EliteBNC.org for giving a free ZNC node. Feels great to be back on IRC after so long.
