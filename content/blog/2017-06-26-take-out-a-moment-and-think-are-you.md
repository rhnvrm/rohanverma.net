Take out a moment and think, are you going on the internet (reddit/youtube/dota2) because you want to be entertained or because you are really afraid of being bored?

Boredom comes from having a mind that wants to be entertained. Instead, strive for cultivating a creative mind that can entertain itself (and others). The key word here is &#8220;cultivate&#8221;.
