  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">ACT I</span></span>
</p>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE IN: </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A long shot of New Delhi and the skyline. The sun is rising breaking dawn. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Camera pans to visuals of empty shopping streets being lit with the morning sunlight. Some shopkeepers can be seen opening their shutters and the silence breaks with the opening of the shutters. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low key piano starts playing and the camera pans to a shot of birds flying across the sky.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO Apartment Complex</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Outside the gate of an apartment complex, heavy traffic can be seen. People rushing out of the complex. Streets are now filled with people who are getting on with their lives.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO Inside the Complex</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Camera shows a smaller, quieter street of the complex. We see a distinct, colorful door in this shot that is the home of our protagonist. It is on the ground floor of the apartment complex that towers 10-15 floors.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see a shot of school children with their school bags waiting for the school bus just on the opposite side of the street.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO shot of 7:00 on a digital alarm clock </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Loud sound of beeping alarm starts playing over the low key piano which fades slowly. We can hear the cars outside and the sounds of traffic. Along with the simple noises of hustle and bustle of the city.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Hand comes into the frame to shut down the sound. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as the alarm is switched off, the radio starts playing pop music with positive beats. We are situated in a usual Indian students room. There are posters of movies and rock bands on the wall. The posters are adding color to the walls of the dusty pale white walls of the room. The girl is still half asleep and brushes her hand through her messy hair. She stares at the clock and listens to the music of the radio and stands up slowly from the bed. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She appears to be in her early twenties in fair shape. She is in her pajamas.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Her feet touch the floor, shot of the magazines and random bits of rubbish lying around. The mess in the room adds to the vibrancy and color of the room.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO Bathroom</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A mirror comes on screen. Sound of rinsing can be heard. Suddenly a face comes into the frame from the bottom. We can see NAINA’s face in the mirror and her messy, entangled and long hair and her back. She looks at the mirror, fixes her hair and smiles. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The shot still focusing on the mirror, we can see her turn around and leave the bathroom, and the mirror without a reflection.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO scene of the common area of apartment.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a brightly lit room with windows. There are sofas and the windows let in the light from outside and fill the room.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can see NAINA walking towards the kitchen from her room with a purse. She is dressed up casually in T shirt and jeans. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can hear the sound of a pressure cooker coming from the kitchen. We can see rays of sunlight streaming in from the kitchen door. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO kitchen</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA entering the kitchen through the door, she looks at her mother making breakfast. She seems enthusiastic for the coming day. We can see her mother breaking an egg on the frying pan. Sound of crackling egg whites on the frying pan can be heard.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA grabs two pieces of fresh bread from the 12 pack of bread that is on the table and pours out a glass of milk from the glass bottle of boiled milk.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA looks at her mother cutting onions for the omelette with a knife.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Good morning mummy! </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">MOM:</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Good morning, had a good night’s sleep beta? You had those bad dreams again?</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Nothing bad mummy…</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA’s mother gives her the plate of cooked omelette and she starts eating it with the bread.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CAMERA PANS TO NAINA </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She is taking the finished plate of her breakfast and washing it in the kitchen sink.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA picking up her purse from beside the dining table.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ok mummy, gotta go! Don’t want to be late for college! See you later.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">MOM:</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Have a nice day beta!</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO outside the apartment </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA walking out of the apartment complex.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The sun is now shining brightly, she is almost blinded by the bright light and crosses the street to the other side. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In the shot we can see children waiting for their school bus in front of the street.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA begins to cross the street.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly, we see a school bus crashing into NAINA.</p> 

<p>
  Sound of screeching tires can be heard.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Immediately fade to black.</b></span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">ACT II</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE IN:</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low key piano strokes play.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO Digital Clock with alarm ringing at 7:00 AM. </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Loud sound of beeping alarm starts.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA jumping from the bed in fear. She looks around and finds herself back in her room.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She shuts the alarm, this time bleaker music plays on the radio.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Seems like it was just a dream.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She stands up from the bed, laying her feet on the ground. We see the same shot of the magazines and random bits of rubbish lying around. But now the color seems to be faded. The room and posters on the wall also look a bit less colorful. There is a tone of bleakness which can be seen.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO bathroom</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA’s back and face in the mirror. She rinses her mouth and puts the toothbrush on the edge of the sink. She puts water from the faucet on her face to wash it. She rubs her eyes. She’s startled to find her reflection to be a bit different. She looks at her hand and then at the reflections hand. She then waves it.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What is happen&#8212;</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is silence, except the sound of the flowing tap, which is also a bit lower in volume than in the previous scene.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly, we hear the sound of something falling, it’s the toothbrush. She looks at it but doesn’t pick it up. She again sees the reflection, and it is seems normal now. A look of being creeped out is visible on her face.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The shot still focusing on the mirror, we can see her turn around, this time frantically leave the bathroom but not the reflection in the mirror.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO scene of the common area of apartment.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can see NAINA walking towards the kitchen from her room. This time she is not dressed up. She is still in her pajamas. We can hear the pressure cooker, but this time the cooker is having a higher pitch. </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Fade to kitchen </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA enters the kitchen, her mom can be seen preparing the breakfast. NAINA sits down at the table. Her mom is making eggs on the frying pan. The crackling sound of the eggs is not heard as clearly as last time.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA grabs a single piece of bread from the 12 pack of bread that is on the table and looks at the bowl of boiled milk.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see her mom turning and looking at her as soon as she grabs the bread.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : Morning Mom</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly, she stops tending to the eggs that are being fried and with a concerned voice says </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">MOM: Good morning, beta.. you sound pretty tired. Did you sleep well?</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This time her voice is different, we hear some disturbances like cracking in the mother&#8217;s voice and it is a bit unclear. </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Bad dreams..</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA grabs the bread and was about to leave when her mom turns to her while cutting onions for the omlette. She looks at her mother who now looks a bit different. This makes her jump against the wall with an astonished and scared face. The bottle of milk falls on the ground and shatters into pieces. Her mother’s face was different, her lips seemed to be inside out, giving her face a look straight out of a nightmare.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mom : What is wrong beta?</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She completely turn towards her, with the knife pointing towards NAINA.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO scene of the common room</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was way too much to handle for NAINA, she can be seen running out of the door and closing it. </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This time outside, it’s not that bright while also being a bit greyed out. </span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She keeps running in panic.</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was when she was running and crossing the street, we again see the same children waiting for their school bus</span></span>
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly, we see the same school bus crashing into NAINA.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Sound of screeching tires can be heard.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The screen fades to black</b></span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE IN</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low piano keystroke plays in the background</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO Digital Clock showing 7:00 AM. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA wakes up with a jump this time. Scared on her bed, sweating like a pig. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The same shot of the magazines and her feet touching the ground. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Her room is very different this time, it is darker, greyer and messier. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO BATHROOM</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The water is running in the sink. NAINA is away from the mirror, toward the camera, lost and scared. She is blocking the reflection in the mirror for the camera.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly a </span></span><span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>voice over</i></span></span><span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> can be heard</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “<span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What are you scared of?”</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA is shocked to her core listening to the voice. She immediately turns toward the mirror since the sound came from behind her. She sees a blurry figure. She rubs her eyes and leans forward. She can see the eyes of the figure which is making eye contact with NAINA. It was her own reflection. She is shocked to look at herself.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: BOOOO!!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA jumps back, away from the mirror in fear with no clue as to what is happening with her. She again looks into the mirror, checks if her reflection is mirroring her. It is!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA starts crying desperately. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Thought that the “BOOOO!” would be clear enough..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Wh-What are you?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The “Reflection” was amazed by such a question. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: “Wh-wh-wh” Do I stutter out a question like this?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: What are you ?.. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Reflection smiles.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: I am what we call a paradox, the question and the answer at the same time, a paradigm all together. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : (shouts) It is not possible..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Or maybe not, may be I am just a product of your imagination or a part of your schizophrenic mind. Or it is also possible that I am a divine intervention, that’d be something unexpected, isn’t ?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: (shouts again) No.. this is not possible!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Impossible is the kind of haircut you have. I look like a dork for God’s sake.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Reflection starts playing with her hair looking at it in dislike. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : What is it that you want?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: I want you to start asking the right questions.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA looks around, it is still her bathroom. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : Where am I ? What is going on with me&#8230; Here ? I do not understand anything.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Wow! One at a time.. I said the right questions not a multi questions pop quiz!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : WHERE AM I?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Look around from your point of view, it is still your bathroom! </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: It is not possible again.. It does not look like my home.. There.. There are no colors.. From where does this noise keep interrupting me?! Th-This is not anything I know. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: How can you be so sure? You must have heard the saying “Ignorance is a blessing”. I.. on the other hand..like to believe that “ Ignorance leads to knowledge”. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Knowledge? </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Yes! Knowledge! Look at yourself, lost in your own ignorance, asking yourself those questions: Where, What,.. But even except from me maybe..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA : What do you mean?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: The further you fall away from knowledge the further you approach knowledge at its pure state!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: This is just a dream… I am just dreaming…</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The reflection continues her speech as if she never heard the last part.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: It is the knowledge about the truth, about the sins, your hidden memories… about you, me, us,.. And.. Her</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:Her?</span></span>

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Don’t you remember?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Remember what?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The headache is getting worse for NAINA</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Think harder! The headache is not gonna stop!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: I don’t remember!!!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: NAINA, NAINA&#8230;!! Do you see, where the knowledge leads you?! Leading you to forget! Leading you to meet me! Leading you to somewhere you do not have a clue about! Do you know how much pain she was in? How much she kept thinking and hoping? Do you? </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: I don’t know what are you talking about ?&#8230;</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Her headache grows stronger, she starts gripping her head hard!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: You don’t remember, do you? No, you don’t, otherwise you would not be here, now would you?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: I have had enough of this. Just tell me what has happened?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: It would be too easy to give all the answers on a plate, look at who you are talking to ? Look at me!! If you can’t remember, how can I possibly tell you ?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: What is that I have to remember ? How can I remember it?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The REFLECTION smiles again </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Didn’t I tell you the answer already “Ignorance is a blessing”! In order to remember you have to forget! Isn’t it ironic?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The REFLECTION laughs. NAINA seems lost!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: What do you mean!! One moment, you are saying you can’t tell me, the other you say something completely opposite! You are playing with me! WHO ARE YOU??</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: OH GOD!!! Let’s not restart the whole conversation again!!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: How can I remember something I have forgotten!!! What are babbling about! Her, Her, Who is “Her”? </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: NAINA, innocent NAINA, why can’t you see the meaning of it? Forget to remember? One never forgets a thing, it is just that when one has stored so much information, learned so many things, year after year that eventually he starts forgetting the most important things, all those things when cumulated result in a sum of all our base memories, feelings and experiences, nothing more, nothing less. However, one chooses to suppress their innermost, traumatic experiences using everyday facts and figures, for reasons unknown to us. Maybe the truth is simply a bit too much for you to handle.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Are you trying to say that the key of this place is my ability to remember? I had never asked to be here in the first place. I honestly do not understand what you want me to remember!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: I wonder, is it me that wants “you” to remember or is it you yourself? Tell me Naina, what are dreams? Taking the words of Shakespeare .. dreams are the “children of an idle mind”, and how right he was! Dreams are our thoughts themselves, one’s deep memories trying to come through, trying to escape! Trying to talk to you, Naina, but have you been listening? </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: It is a trick.. You are trying to trick me.. I am not supposed to be here!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: What were you dreaming last night, Naina?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Listening to this, Naina suddenly freezes, her headache is too much. She cannot think at all.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: You were dreaming about her. Think! Think harder! Naina… weren’t you? </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Y..Yes, I think so, .. She was there all alone.. Waiting for someone… someone special.. But she does not seem to come…</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: How long she had been waiting, Naina ? How long has she been waiting?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: She has been waiting forever! She believes she will come. She does not give up hope.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Why isn’t she coming ? Did she forget about her?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:N-NO..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina is silently looking into her reflection.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: How does she look like, Naina?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: She-</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina pauses in disbelief</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina: I do not remember… I cannot remember..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: You can’t remember her face? (smiles) What happened Naina? Is there something else you can remember?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: I was with her.. It’s you!! It’s all you playing games with me </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">(Reflection laughs)</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: It seems you really do not want to listen do you? Just look at your hands….</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina looks at her hands, they are all covered with blood, dripping from her hands. Blood.. Not hers.. From someone else…</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: WHAT IS THIS ???</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: (laughs)</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> Oh-oh you tell me Naina!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina: I know it’s all you playing games with me! It’s all your fault! IT’S ALL YOU!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina tries to grab the reflection, but her hands just hit the mirror leaving bloody handprints on it.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: It’s all a dream…</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Have you ever wondered that maybe that dream about her was not one, that it might have been reality? Maybe this is not a dream, maybe your so called “life” is a dream! Maybe you aren’t even alive at all! (laughs) Or maybe it’s a question of sanity Naina! I don’t think that talking to your reflection is what you call the sanest thing on the planet.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The REFLECTION smiles, Naina seems to be totally lost. The noise is getting louder, her heart beating faster and faster.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA: Where am I .. This isn’t a world!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: You are right.. In a way.. Different perspectives, different worlds.. Life is just a dream, Naina.. A dream..</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Blood starts dripping from the Reflection’s eyes!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION : That&#8211;</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Naina covers her eyes with her hands, two hands suddenly approach Naina&#8230;They come from the mirror…</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8211;ends!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">They suddenly grab Naina and push her to the mirror, her face is pressed against the mirror! Face to face with herself!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">REFLECTION: Fading memories, new memories! And a dream Naina, a ream of you in a world without you! (smiles) Welcome to my world!</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">SCREAM</span></span>

    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">ACT III</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE IN:</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low key piano strokes play.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO Digital Clock showing 7:00 AM. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We are again inside the room.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA wakes up suddenly, this time she looks around her room, it is still bleak and the posters seem faded and colorless.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She shuts off the alarm, the radio is playing static this time.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see the same shot of her feet touching the ground. The magazines on the floor are colorless. There is no noise of the traffic or the hustle and bustle of city life. It’s all quiet.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO bathroom</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The camera is focused on the mirror.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA rushes inside the bathroom, we can only see her back and messy hair. She looks at herself in the mirror, the mirror reflects all her movements precisely.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She knocks on the mirror.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">HELLO!!??</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no reaction from the reflection. NAINA smiles.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Was nothing but a dream.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She turns her back away from the mirror and walks away. She doesn&#8217;t notice the water that had been flowing from the water tap on the sink. The flow is fast but there is no noise. No sound.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The camera zooms in on the mirror and the door of the bathroom that is visible until the edges of the mirror are not visible.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO Common Room</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA walking in a fast pace from the bathroom toward the kitchen. We see her feet stomp on the ground but there is no noise. Only a grey and dark common room with curtains closed, no light coming in.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can see the fluorescent white light from the kitchens tube light lighting up the common room area</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO camera inside the kitchen looking toward the kitchen door.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can see the dining table, a pack of 12 pieces of bread that looks like it has been open since a few days. The bowl in which we saw boiled milk seems to be empty. We can see the pressure cooker on the stove, it seems to have been untouched since a few days.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA walks into the kitchen through the door with a smile on her paranoid face.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Her smile disappears as she doesn&#8217;t find her MOM in the kitchen. She walks toward the stove, glaring at the knife… The same knife that she was using to cut onions now lies next to finely diced stale onions. </span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The camera now pans and follows her face from not so far distance</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She bumps herself on the dining table, causing the bottle of milk to fall down and make the glass shatter but there is no sound except muffled sound of something glass like falling for the audience. She doesn&#8217;t hear it and continues to see the half eaten omelette still on the plate.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She then looks at the white milk that is flowing outward from the shattered glass to fill the dark floor.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">NAINA:</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What… is going on?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She now panics and starts breathing heavily heading outside.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">FADE TO the common room</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We see NAINA now walking briskly towards the door that opens outside the apartment. She opens the door, and walks out.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO Shot of Empty Street outside of Apartment facing the door</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can see the color of the door of the house has faded away. We see NAINA staring into oblivion. The towering apartment block looks dull. The street is empty, all gray, nothing but silence surrounds the once busy. Except the sound of wind blowing past NAINA.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The children who were waiting for their bus are now no more waiting for their bus.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CUT TO apartment complex</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Outside the gate, no traffic can be seen. There are no people rushing in and out of the complex. Visuals of empty shopping streets with their shutters down.</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Courier\ New, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low key piano starts playing with a shot of birds flying across the sky.</span></span>
