The use of Facial Recognition by law enforcement to identify offenders is one of
the cases where the regulation of the technology lags way behind, and there is
an urgent need to bring about policy to reduce potential pain in our society.
Apart from the serious problems that are inherent with the technology like
mis-identification and minimal mapping between the training sets and the actual
photos. According to a recent report in TechCrunch [1], the Home Minister of
India admitted to using a data set trained on the Aadhaar Database to identify
individuals involved in a recent riot. This software was originally obtained in
the name of a good cause, to identify missing children, although according to
the report [1] the software failed to even distinguish between boys and girls.
Recent advances in AI have made certain model that perform recognition by
training on huge datasets, unfortunately they are considered to be black boxes.
Along with this, there is a question of how in line it is with the Privacy Laws
and the inherent questions of cyber-security. To address these issues, we should
open discourse on these topics with experts. Unlike the approach in the west [2]
to ban the tech, we should try to come up with a middle ground. Ideally, a
policy should be discussed to thoroughly document the process of how the model
was trained and the dataset that was used in the process. After the model is
trained and put into production, there should a mandatory requirement to
disclose the uses of the model along with the false-negatives in a proper
manner. Using this information, there should be regular reviews to revisit the
efficacy of the model. A mechanism should be devised to be able to appeal for
manual review by an expert in case a person who is identified by this system. A
person should also be able to opting out of being incriminated by the use of
this technology. Such mechanisms, in such a policy, would address the privacy
concerns as well.
