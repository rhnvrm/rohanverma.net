Dear upi.link users

Thanks for using upi.link and making it grow organically to over ~2k daily hits.

Due to a takedown request for the domain upi.link from the NPCI I have had to 
shutdown upi.link for now.

I had created upi.link to solve my own problem. Till date, sharing a upi request
outside an App is not possible without an intermediary for free. After sharing a
prototype with people in my workplace, I found out that it was useful beyond
what I had imagined. I shared it with more
people and finally put it up online. It has not been my best work 
but more or less was an experiment for me. Running upi.link with the least
amount of cost and infra setup was personal challenge for me. For over a year I
had run this without any extra cost to me except the domain name.

Unfortunately, I was naive when I started building this to assume that the
NPCI is a government body and UPI is a platform. In reality, the NPCI is a 
non-profit (not non-commercial) body and UPI is its product. Even though some  
of the UPI spec is open, it can hardly be called an open product. NPCI owns 
a trademark for UPI and also has a guideline for domains using the trademark. 

At the moment, I am working on other things and I don't have the resources to
keep the upi.link domain online by either asking/paying NPCI for allowing use of
this domain nor do I have any bandwidth in further developing anything on top of
upi.link as of now. 

I would also like to add that being involved in the fintech space in India, I
have come to appreciate what UPI has provided all of us in the short term. I am 
also aware of the rising amounts of scams happening with UPI which the
NPCI tries to prevent through partner apps like BHIM, GooglePay, PhonePe etc. 
Also, the fact that it has successfully reached out and onboarded 
so many people and organizations is a monumental feat in itself. 

Some people, had suggested open sourcing this project but unfortunately; some
decisions, I had taken to reduce the cost of hosting the website, hinder the scope
of opensourcing the project.

Regards
