I recently read the blog about the [200 most common passwords of 2020](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/). It was
also featured in Jon Snader's [recent blog post](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9301). When the original post was made,
I had glanced at the mysterious `x4ivygA51F`, which appeared at the 148th spot.
But when I read the blog post again and searched for an update on it, no one had
been able to figure out what that meant.

There were some guesses. Few folks on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/jxtnet/200%5Fworst%5Fpasswords%5Ffor%5F2020/) and [4chan](https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/78809839/why-is-x4ivyga51f-the-148th-most-common-password), guessed that it might be
password written in another language. This guess was based on a [gizmodo article](https://gizmodo.com/why-ji32k7au4a83-is-a-remarkably-common-password-1833045282),
which mentions something similar. To confirm this hypothesis, I tried searching
for Chinese websites if I could find some mention of this. There was little to
no mention of this to be able to confirm this, at least on what is to be found
through the indexed web on Google or Bing.

Although, one interesting finding here that I saw no one talk about was a
post on the forum of a website called 51haoyou. The post on this forum, which
talks about a breach by hackers on January 10, 2019 talks about this specific
password. In a footnote on [this post](http://www.51haoyou.com/discuzx3.2/thread-4903.html), it mentions the following:

I guess that it could mean that the Discuz forum software by default suggests
this password somewhere on the registration page. Or administratively this is
set to be the default password somewhere by this BB software. Using the Cangjie
input method, I found those keystrokes build and translate to [`Question 1`](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&tab=TT&authuser=0#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E7%94%A0%E9%A1%8C1%E7%81%AB).
Something similar does come up on the [login page](http://www.51haoyou.com/discuzx3.2/member.php?mod=register) this does come up in terms of
security question, although this could be entirely incorrect as I don't know
Chinese or Cangjie. Another guess here is that this is the breach that led to
the inclusion of this password in the list itself.
