Toured Seville today thanks to https://www.feelthecitytours.com/en/tours/sevilla/ . They are an amazing company with a great tour of this beautiful city. Got to learn a lot about the city along with a bunch of great stories about the city. One of them was the story of Carmen (http://www.geocities.jp/wakaru_opera/englishcarmen.html) which is a pretty nice story. 

The TAC meeting was pretty nice and was followed by the TAC team dinner at a Tapas restaurant. 

Excited about the first day tomorrow.
