Objective of this project was to show as a proof of concept that we can pick up any off-the-shelf generic lamp and by implementing minor hardware changes using an arduino, convert it into a Smart Lamp. We have implemented lamp switching based on environmental factors (such as Temperature, Light intensity etc), hand gestures (such a clapping actions), which can be set up by the user by attaching triggers to various conditions in the User Dashboard which was made in Processing 3.
