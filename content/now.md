## Currently Working On

I'm deep into backend infrastructure work at Zerodha, focusing on improving our order management systems and exploring new monitoring approaches. It's fascinating work that involves balancing performance, reliability, and maintainability at scale.

Outside of work, I've been tinkering with some personal projects:
- Experimenting with Rust for system-level tools
- Building a small CLI utility for managing my personal notes and todos
- Contributing to a few open source projects when I find interesting issues

## Reading & Learning

Currently making my way through "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann (again - it's one of those books that reveals new insights on each read). Also diving into some papers on distributed consensus algorithms.

On the lighter side, I've been enjoying some travel writing and philosophy. There's something refreshing about stepping away from technical content and exploring different perspectives on life and culture.

## Travel & Exploration

Just returned from a wonderful trip to Kerala - the backwaters were incredibly peaceful, and the food was absolutely incredible. There's something about traveling in India that always reminds me how diverse and beautiful this country is.

Planning a trek in Himachal Pradesh for next month. Looking forward to some time in the mountains and away from screens.

## Current Interests

- **Photography**: Picked up my camera again after a long break. Been focusing on street photography and trying to capture the everyday moments that make up life in the city.
- **Cooking**: Experimenting with South Indian cuisine, particularly trying to master the art of making perfect dosas.
- **Music**: Rediscovering some old indie bands and exploring new artists on Spotify. Recently been listening to a lot of Prateek Kuhad and Nucleya.

## What I'm Thinking About

The balance between building things that scale and building things that are maintainable has been on my mind a lot lately. There's always this tension in engineering between moving fast and building something that will last.

Also been reflecting on the importance of writing and sharing ideas. This website is part of that - creating a space to document thoughts, experiences, and things I've learned along the way.
